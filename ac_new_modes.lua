---If script would use `ac.setStartMessage('Some message')` at its initialization, mode would switch to a preparation stage,
---during which `prepare()` function will be called each frame. Once it returns `true`, signaling that everything is ready
---to run, mode would go back to running stage, in which `prepare()` would no longer be called and instead `update()` would
---be called each frame.
---@param dt number @Time of a frame, in seconds.
---@return boolean @True if it’s time to start the race/drive/challenge/etc.

---Called each frame when mode is not in preparation stage. See `prepare()` for more details.
---@see script.prepare

---Called when rendering transparent objects (which are rendered after opaque objects). Draw any of your own debug shapes here,
---so they’d be on top of everything else spared by ExtraFX post-processing.

---Called when tool is shown. Script as a whole would run the moment tool is shown, but it would not stop when tool is closed.
