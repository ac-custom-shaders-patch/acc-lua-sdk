-- script format:
---@class ScriptData
---@field update fun(dt: number, mode: ac.CockpitCameraMode, turnMix: number) @Called each frame. Param `dt` is time since the last call of `.update()` in seconds. Param `mode` is current mode (mostly for checking if VR is active and stopping extra rotation if so). Param `turnMix` is how much to turn head willingly (goes to 0 with TrackIR or mouse camera rotation).
