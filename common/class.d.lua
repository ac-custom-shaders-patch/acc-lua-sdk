---A base class for objects with pooling. Doesn’t add anything, but you can add it as a parent class
---so that `recycled()` would be documented.
---@class ClassPool : ClassBase
local _classPool = {}

---Called when object is about to get recycled.
---@return boolean @Return false if this object should not be recycled and instead destroyed as usual.
function _classPool:recycled() end

---Create a new class. Example:
---
---```
---local MyClass = class('MyClass')        -- class declaration
---
---function MyClass:initialize(arg1, arg2) -- constructor
---  self.myField = arg1 + arg2            -- field
---end
---
---function MyClass:doMyThing()            -- method
---  print(self.myField)
---end
---
---local instance = MyClass(1, 2)          -- creating instance of a class
---instance:doMyThing()                    -- calling a method
---```
---
---Whole thing is very similar to [middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass), but it’s a different
---implementation that should be somewhat faster. Main differences:
---
---1. Class name is stored in `YourClass.__name` instead of `YourClass.name`.
---
---2. There is no `.static` subtable, all static fields and methods are instead stored in main class
---   table and thus are available as instance fields and methods as well (that’s why `YourClass.name` was
---   renamed to `YourClass.__name`, to avoid possible confusion with a common field name). It’s a bit
---   messier, especially with class methods such as `:subclass()`, but it has some advantages as well:
---   objects creation is faster, and it’s more EmmyLua-friendly (both of which is what it’s all about).
---
---3. Overloaded `__tostring`, `__len` and `__call` are inherited, but not other operators.
---
---4. Method `YourClass.allocate()` works differently here and is used to create a simple table which will be
---   passed to `setmetatable()`. This can help with performance if objects are created often.
---
---Everything else should work the same, including inheritance and mixins. As for performance, some simple
---tests show up to 30% faster objects creation and 40% less memory used for objects with two fields when
---using `YourClass.allocate()` method instead of `YourClass:initialize()` (that alone gives about 15% increase in speed
---when creating an object with two fields):
---
---```
---function YourClass.allocate(arg1, arg2)  -- notice . instead of :
---  return { myField = arg1 + arg2 }     -- also notice, methods are not available at this stage
---end
---```
---
---Other differences (new features rather than something breaking compatibility) and important notes:
---
---1. Function `class()` takes string for class name, another class to act like a parent,
---   allocate and initialize functions and flags. Everything is optional and can go in any order (with one caveat:
---   allocate function should go before initialize function unless you’re using `class.Pool`). Generally there is no
---   benefit in passing allocate and initialize functions here though.
---
---2. With flag `class.NoInitialize` constructor would not look for `YourClass:initialize()` method to call at all,
---   instead using only `YourClass.allocate()`. Might speed things up a bit further.
---
---3. If you’re creating new instances really often, there is a `class.Pool` flag. It would disable the use of
---   `YourClass.allocate()`, but instead allow to reuse unused objects by using `class.recycle(object)`. Recycled objects
---   would end up in a pool of objects to be reused next time an instance would need to be created. Of course, it
---   introduces a whole new type of errors (imagine storing a reference to a recycled item somewhere not knowing it was
---   recycled and now represents something else entirely), so please be careful.
---
---   Note 1: Method `class.recycle()` can be used with nils or non-recycle, no need to have extra checks before calling it.
--- 
---   Note 2: Instances of child classes won’t end up in parent class pool. For such arrangements, consider adding pooling
---           flag to all of child classes where appropriate.
---
---4. Before recycling, method `YourClass:recycled()` will be called. Good time to recycle any inner elements. Also,
---   return `false` from it and object would not be recycled at all.
---
---5. To check type, `YourClass.isInstanceOf(item)` can also be used. Notice that it’s a static method, no “:” here.
---
---All classes are considered children classes of `ClassBase`, that one is mostly for EmmyLua to pick up methods like 
---`YourClass.isInstanceOf(object)`. If you’re creating your own class and want to use such methods, just add `: ClassBase`
---to its EmmyLua annotation. And objects with pooling are children of `ClassPool` which is a child of `ClassBase`. Note: 
---to speed things up, those classes aren’t fully real, but you can access them and their methods and even call things like
---`ClassBase:include()`. Please read documentation for those functions before using them though, just to check.

---@param flags nil | integer | `class.NoInitialize` | `class.Pool` | `class.Minimal` @Flags.

---@overload fun(name: string, initializeFn: `function (self) end, class.Pool`)               @With pooling for best memory reuse
---@overload fun(allocateFn: `function() return {} end, class.NoInitialize + class.Minimal`)  @Most minimal version
---@return ClassDefinition @New class definition
function class(name, parentClass, flags) end

class = {}

---Skip initialization function completely. Might slightly speed up object creation.
class.NoInitialize = 1

---Reuse recycled objects instead of creating new ones. Disables `.allocate()` and switches to `:initialize()`,
---but performance gain from not having to allocate new tables is worth it. Don’t forget to recycle unused elements
---with `class.recycle(item)`.
class.Pool = 2

---Minimal version of a class, skips creation of all static methods and default to-string operators.
---
---To use with either pooling or no-initialize setup, pass two flags separated by a comma, or just sum them together
---(would work only if values are powers of two and you’re not summing together the same flag twice). Or, use
---`bit.bor(flag1, flag2)`, courtesy of LuaJIT and its BitOp extension.
class.Minimal = 4

---Recycle an item to its pool, to speed up creation and reduce work for GC. Requires class to be created with
---`class.Pool` flag.
---
---This method has protection from double recycling, recycling nils or non-recycleable items, so don’t worry about it.
---@param item ClassPool|nil
function class.recycle(item) end

---A trick to get `class()` to work with EmmyLua annotations nicely. Call `class.emmy(YourClass, YourClass.initialize)`
---or `class.emmy(YourClass, YourClass.allocate)` (whatever you’re using) and it would give you a constructor function.
---Then, use it for local reference or as a return value from module. For best results add annotations to function you’re
---passing here, such as return value or argument types.
---
---In reality is simply returns the class back and ignores second argument, but because of this definition EmmyLua thinks
---it got the constructor.
---@generic T1
---@generic T2
---@param classFn T1
---@param constructorFn T2
---@return T1|T2
function class.emmy(classFn, constructorFn) return constructorFn end
